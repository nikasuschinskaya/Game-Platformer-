# Game-Platformer-
Game Platformer is a dekstop game written in the C# programming language and its own game engine that uses the OpenTK wrapper library of the OpenGL graphics library.

## User Interface

After launching the developed game application, the main menu window appears, which contains a pleasant-looking background, the name of the game and four buttons: "Start the game", "About the author", "Help" and "Exit".

## Gameplay

After clicking on the "Start Game" button, the OpenTK library window opens with the first level of the game application loaded. At the first level, the main goals for the player are to master the control of the character, to get to know the enemies, as well as to observe what health points are taken away for and get their first key. The key is a block-a transition to the next level.
